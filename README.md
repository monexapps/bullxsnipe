# Keycut

A macOS automation tool designed for speedy token sniping on BullX platform.

## Overview

Keycut enables lightning-fast token purchases by automating the token address input process for BullX trading. When combined with Telegram Nova's auto-buy feature, it creates a streamlined sniping workflow.

## How It Works

1. **Setup**: Run the app with Telegram Nova and BullX open
2. **Copy Token**: Copy any token contract address to your clipboard
3. **Auto-Paste**: Keycut automatically detects the copied token address and pastes it into the BullX bot
4. **Execute**: The token address is instantly submitted to BullX
5. **Auto-Buy**: If Nova's auto-buy feature is enabled, the purchase executes immediately
